# Copilot Instructions - MO-IT104 Computer Networks Course

## Project Overview
This is a structured academic course repository for Computer Networks (MO-IT104) following a semester-long learning progression. The codebase is organized around educational materials, logging systems for study tracking, and progressive weekly content delivery focused on OSI/TCP-IP networking models.

## Architecture Patterns

### Academic Structure
- **Weekly Organization**: `WEEK-1/` through `WEEK-12/` contain SOURCE (input materials) and OUTPUT (student work) subdirectories
- **Logging System**: Centralized academic progress tracking via `logging-system/` with PowerShell automation
- **Course Materials**: `COURSE DETAILS/` contains syllabus and institutional documentation
- **Progress Tracking**: `course-activity.log` serves as the master activity timeline

### Key Components
- **Automated Logging**: `logging-system/scripts/course-log.ps1` provides structured academic logging with predefined types (STUDY, LAB, CONCEPT, etc.)
- **Template System**: `logging-system/templates/` contains markdown templates for different academic activities
- **Documentation Patterns**: Each activity follows timestamp-based logging: `[timestamp] | TYPE | TOPIC | DESCRIPTION | STATUS`

## Essential Workflows

### Academic Logging Workflow
```powershell
# Primary logging command structure
.\logging-system\scripts\course-log.ps1 -Type "STUDY" -Topic "TCP_IP" -Description "Reading Chapter 3" -Status "PROGRESS"
```

### Valid Log Types
- Academic: `STUDY`, `LECTURE`, `ASSIGNMENT`, `QUIZ`, `EXAM`, `REVIEW`, `REFLECTION`
- Technical: `LAB`, `PROTOCOL`, `TOOL`, `SIMULATION`, `TROUBLESHOOT`, `CONFIG`
- Progress: `CONCEPT`, `PROGRESS`, `CHALLENGE`, `BREAKTHROUGH`, `GOAL`, `PLAN`

### Status Classifications
- Active: `PLANNED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `STARTED`, `PROGRESS`, `INVESTIGATING`
- Completed: `COMPLETED`, `RESOLVED`, `BREAKTHROUGH`, `POSITIVE`, `NOTED`
- Blocked: `OBSTACLE`

## Project-Specific Conventions

### File Naming
- Week materials: Numbered files like `1-reflection.md`, `-1.md` (negative indicates source material)
- Templates: ALL_CAPS with descriptive suffixes (e.g., `LAB_SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`)
- Logs: Structured timestamps with pipe-delimited fields

### Documentation Patterns
1. **Pre-activity Planning**: Always log preparation steps with `PLANNED` status
2. **Real-time Progress**: Log during work with `IN_PROGRESS`/`PROGRESS` status
3. **Post-activity Reflection**: Document outcomes with `COMPLETED`/`BREAKTHROUGH` status
4. **Problem Documentation**: Use `CHALLENGE`/`OBSTACLE` â†’ `SOLUTION`/`RESOLVED` pattern

### Course-Specific Context
- **MotorPH Project**: Terminal assessment involves designing network infrastructure for this fictional company
- **Packet Tracer Focus**: Cisco simulation tool is primary technical platform
- **CCNA Preparation**: Course designed as first step toward Cisco certification
- **Milestone Structure**: MS1 (Architecture), MS2 (Implementation), Terminal Assessment (Documentation)

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Primary network simulation environment
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analysis tool
- **PowerShell**: Automation and logging infrastructure (Windows-centric)

### Academic Calendar Integration
- Assignment deadlines are semester-specific (Sep-Nov 2025)
- Weekly progression follows academic calendar structure
- Logging timestamps enable progress analytics

## Development Guidelines

When creating new content or modifying existing materials:
1. **Maintain Academic Structure**: Preserve WEEK-X/SOURCE and OUTPUT separation
2. **Use Logging System**: All activities should generate appropriate log entries
3. **Follow Template Patterns**: Reference existing templates for consistency
4. **Respect Learning Progression**: Content builds sequentially through OSI layers
5. **Document Real Learning**: Focus on actual educational outcomes, not aspirational goals

## Key Files for Understanding
- `README.md`: Course overview and assignment schedule
- `logging-system/README.md`: Complete logging system documentation
- `COURSE DETAILS/SYLLABUS.md`: Official course requirements and structure
- `course-activity.log`: Master timeline of all academic activities
- `logging-system/scripts/course-log.ps1`: Primary automation tool
