# MO-IT104 - Computer Networks

## Course Overview

**Computer Networks** is a 3-unit course that introduces the OSI and TCP/IP networking models. With a focus on OSI, learners explore various standards, protocols, topologies, and networking elements applicable to each OSI layer. Learners also practice creating high-level network diagrams and defining appropriate IP addressing and subnetting schemes.

This course emphasizes the role of problem-solving and managing risks when designing a network diagram that meets clients' needs. The learnings and insights from this course allow the learners to practice and develop the competencies required to succeed in more complex courses and prepare them for the first step in taking the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification.

## Course Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Identify the components of a network diagram** according to requirements and constraints
2. **Troubleshoot hardware** following the prescribed methodology
3. **Develop risk reduction strategies** that mitigate risks when deploying a network
4. **Make informed decisions** in developing a network diagram by understanding requirements and analyzing the interdependencies between standards, protocols, and topologies of the different layers in the OSI model

## Terminal Assessment

In groups, learners create and present a **network design document** that meets MotorPH's requirements for opening a physical headquarters that employees from different departments will use. The network design document should provide:

- Visual representation and design rationale
- Troubleshooting steps for issues that may be encountered
- Risk reduction policies to manage reliability, sustainability, and redundancy

## Major Milestones

### Milestone 1: High-Level Network Design
Create a high-level network design that addresses MotorPH's requirements and constraints, including:
- High-level network diagram
- List of required components (e.g., switches, routers, firewalls)

### Milestone 2: Implementation and Testing
Implement the high-level network design and subnetting using Packet Tracer. Test connectivity through successful transmission and reception.

### Terminal Assessment
Create a comprehensive network design document that includes MS1 and MS2 outputs, plus detailed analysis of intentional misconfigurations or risks identified, including symptoms and troubleshooting processes.
