# Introduction

What were the advancements you’ve seen in the last 3-5 years? How did they change how you usually do things? Did they make things better or worse? Advancements and technology often go hand in hand. For example, the invention of the microprocessor/CPU (central processing unit) paved the way for personal computers, smartphones, medical devices, and so on. These, in turn, enabled the development of advancements in other areas, such as software development, data storage, and computer networking.The last three to five years have pushed the development of the following trends and advancements in the field of computer networking alone:

* 5G Networks: [5G networks](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/what-is-5g.html) offer faster speeds, lower latency, and higher capacity, enabling a new generation of applications and services. With the introduction of 5G, you may eventually see more advancements in areas like augmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles.
* Cloud Computing: [Cloud computing](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/) has become a standard way of delivering software and services through the introduction of Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) have made it easier for businesses and individuals to access computing resources on-demand.
* Internet of Things (IoT): The [IoT](https://www.oracle.com/ph/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/) has continued to grow as more devices connect to the Internet. These include smart homes, wearable technology, and industrial IoT applications. This created new business opportunities for collecting and analyzing data, automating processes, and improving efficiency.
* Artificial Intelligence (AI): [AI](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/research-topics/what-is-ai-for-networking.html#:~:text=AI%20enables%20IT%20systems%20to,outage%2C%20helping%20to%20speed%20troubleshooting.) is being integrated into networking technologies, enabling new applications and services. For example, AI can be used for network optimization, anomaly detection, and security. AI is also being used to improve the performance of cloud services and network traffic management.

Even as the world adjusts to these advancements, new and evolved trends and technologies are already emerging, including the following:

* Edge Computing: [Edge computing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-edge-computing/) is a distributed computing architecture that brings processing closer to the data source. This can reduce latency and improve performance for applications like IoT and AI.
* Quantum Networking: [Quantum networking](https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/quantum-internet-explained) is a new approach to networking that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum networking has the potential to enable secure communication and faster processing for complex problems.
* Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7: Wi-Fi 6 and [Wi-Fi 7](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-wifi-7/) are new standards for wireless networking that offer faster speeds and better performance. Wi-Fi 7 is expected to offer speeds of up to 30 Gbps, enabling new applications and services.
* 6G Networks: While 5G networks are still being deployed, researchers are already working on the next generation of wireless networks, [6G](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/what-is-6g-and-when-will-it-launch-telco-execs-predict.html). 6G networks are expected to offer even faster speeds, lower latency, and higher capacity than 5G.

By the time you graduate from MMDC, there may be more advancements and new technologies that you will be or need to be exposed to. To prepare you for that future, you’ll start with the basics through the Computer Networks course.

# Computer Networks Defined

A computer network is a group of interconnected computers and other devices (such as printers, servers, and routers) that can communicate with each other to share information and resources. Computers and devices in a network can be located in the same physical location or dispersed across multiple locations. They are connected by various communication channels such as cables, wireless connections, or satellite links.
![][image1]
In a computer network, data is transmitted between devices using a standardized set of rules and protocols that ensure the data is delivered reliably and efficiently. Networks can be used to share files, access shared resources like printers or databases, communicate via email or messaging systems, and connect to the internet.
Computer networks can be likened to a transportation system with various modes of transportation (e.g., cars, buses, trains, and airplanes) interconnected to transport people, goods, and services from one location to another.
![][image2]
Like a transportation system with cars, buses, or trains, in a computer network, there are various devices such as computers, servers, routers, and switches that are interconnected to transport data, applications, and services from one location to another.
If you look at different modes of transportation, they have different capabilities and capacities. In the same way, different devices in a computer network have different capabilities and capacities in terms of processing power, memory, storage, and bandwidth. Just as roads, highways, and airports are the infrastructure that supports a transportation system, cables, wireless connections, and network devices are the infrastructure that supports a computer network.
To efficiently transport people and information, both a transportation system and computer network need standardized protocols and procedures to ensure that people or information arrive at its intended destination in a timely and reliable manner. And just as advances in transportation technology have transformed the way we travel and connect with one another, advances in computer networking technology continue to transform the way we communicate, collaborate, and access information.
The better you understand how computer networks work, the better you can provide support to companies you will work for in the future. Hand in hand with this understanding are the relevant competencies that you need to bring with you as you work, not just in computer networking but in the information technology industry in general.

# Problem-solving and Documentation

The ability to solve problems and document information and processes are crucial in any role, not just in computer networking or information technology. To put the importance of these competencies in perspective, read the following articles:

* [British Airways’ System Issue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/07/british-airways-it-failures-create-chaos-for-passengers.html#:~:text=And%20in%20May%202017%20a,failures%20would%20never%20happen%20again.)
* [Delta Outage](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/30/delta-outage-airline-technology-problems/97250834/)
* [Southwest Airlines’ Failed Router](https://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/airlines/2016/07/20/southwest-airlines-computer-woes-delaying-flights/87354164/)
* [Equifax Data Breach](https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/equifax-security-breach)

Based on the articles you’ve read, what issues or problems did these companies encounter? How did these issues impact the business?
As you saw in the articles above, failure in infrastructure, even with just a failed router, can cost a company millions of dollars and lose the faith of its customers.
In the case of Equifax, it was later discovered that the breach was caused by a vulnerability in their software, which had a patch available two months prior to the breach. Equifax failed to apply the patch, leaving the system vulnerable to attack. There was also an issue with handling security incidents, leading to a delay in issue identification and public notification, leading to widespread criticism and loss of trust. Due to this incident, Equifax had to pay at least $575 million.
Remember that regardless of how far trends and technologies go, they are still anchored in the overall IT architecture. To quote an article from [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/content/guides/a-guide-to-network-troubleshooting), *`“As an organization’s technology footprint grows, its network needs will also change, and troubleshooting will become more challenging and critical.”`*
To support your troubleshooting or problem-solving, you must understand what architecture exists or what processes to follow based on available [documentation](https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/importance-of-network-documentation/).
In this course, as you enhance your understanding of computer networks, you’ll also work on your problem-solving and documentation skills.
