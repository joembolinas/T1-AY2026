This answer sheet shows clear computations based on stated assumptions. Replace inputs with official values if provided.

## Assumptions used
- Depreciation method: Straight-line
- Useful life: 4 years
- Salvage value: 10% of cost
- Current tag price (given): ₱24,999
- Last purchase budget: [to be provided]
- 2019 price: [to be researched or assumed with citation]
- Rounding: Nearest peso

## Item 1. Fill the values table
- Cost Price (C): ₱24,999
- Salvage Price (S): 10% × 24,999 = ₱2,500 (rounded)
- Useful Life (L): 4 years
- Depreciation per year (D): (C − S) / L = (24,999 − 2,500) / 4 = 22,499 / 4 = ₱5,625
- Depreciation Rate (r): D / C = 5,625 / 24,999 ≈ 22.50%

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Cost Price | ₱24,999 |
| Salvage Price | ₱2,500 |
| Useful Life | 4 years |
| Depreciation Rate | ≈ 22.50% |
| Depreciation Value (per year) | ₱5,625 |

Notes: If your instructor requires exact salvage (e.g., an integer peso), set S precisely and recompute; rate will adjust.

## Item 2. Price of ASUS X453M in 2019
Approach options:
- Preferred: Cite a documented 2019 tag price (archived product/retailer page). Insert source link and value here.
- If not available, state an explicit assumption and justify it.

Template (fill once known):
- Assumed/Cited 2019 price (P2019) = ₱[value] (source: [link])
- Computation shown (if any adjustment): [explain if using MSRP vs. retail, promos, etc.]

---

## Item 3. Units purchasable this year under prior budget
Let B = last purchase budget.
- Units = floor(B / 24,999)
Examples (delete after using real B):
- If B = ₱300,000 → Units = floor(300,000 / 24,999) = 12
- If B = ₱250,000 → Units = floor(250,000 / 24,999) = 10

## Item 4. Recommendations to MotorPH
- Plan a 4-year lifecycle; align with 3-year on-site warranty and optional extended coverage.
- Track TCO beyond tag price: accessories, maintenance, downtime risk, support.
- Negotiate bulk discounts and consider timing (seasonal promos); evaluate nearby comparable models.
- Maintain an asset register with serials and a depreciation schedule to support finance/audit.
- If budget is short, consider staged procurement (e.g., buy 8 now, 4 later) or small spec adjustments.
